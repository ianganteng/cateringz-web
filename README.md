# cateringz-web
Cateringz is my HCI course individual projects in my 2nd semester. It's quite simple because it doesn't require a database and only focuses on UI design which I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The catering website and its prototype in Figma are made interactive, although not all of the features work perfectly.
